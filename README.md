# About Donald Easy Calculator
### This will be my second project in the Full Stack Developing Diploma Course at the Code Institute. This is an easy calculator where instead of using clicked numbers and other tabs you can simply just input the numbers on the two boxes and pick the operator to get a desired value.

# Website
[Visit the website]() [,explore the page, and do calculation ](https://lionkiller900.github.io/test/)

# UX 
### This project is meant to give an easy acess of calculator 
## User stories
This website is useful because:
- It is easy to simply input numbers and choose an operator
- Its easily downloadable

## Mockups
This is a one page website. This hence makes it easy to use. This is because a basic scientific calculator do not need more details.

## Wireframing
This is a one=page wireframe sketch. Here it is [here]()

### Features
As we may know it, this is a project were Javascript is utilised to create a calculator. To be more sure of how this work was sketched see the screenshot of both Javascript and the HTML:
